# React Template

A combination of a React starter page with some basic webassembly but without Creat React App!

You need to first install [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

And then:

npm run buildWASM

npm start

# Inspirations for my code:

### Starter template built on webpack v5 with webpack-dev-server v3
